# Problem statement
Create an application that allows employees to submit feedback toward each other’s performance

# Instructions
You are ALLOWED to style the app any way you like, you can use any CSS framework if you want.
You are ALLOWED to google and read how to approach the problem.
DO NOT copy and paste code from the internet.
DO NOT cheat with other students. REMEMBER: These tests are for YOU so that you can learn something new. Cheating won’t help. It’s better to not submit the solution than to cheat and submit. PS: There will be a plagiarism check and when found cheating, you won’t be allowed to give future tests.
Once you have finished with the test, make a video recording your computer screen (via phone or a software like OBS/screencastify etc) and explaining how you have approached the problem IN CODE and showing ALL THE FEATURES OF the final product. The video can be UPTO 5 mins long. Please don’t record videos longer than that.
Upload the code on github as well, you might not host it SO MAKE SURE VIDEO IS PERFECT (you MIGHT need to host it somewhere I will share the steps if hosting would be required).
Once you have recorded the video, upload it on youtube (unlisted or whatever).
